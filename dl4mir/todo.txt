things to do
x beat-synchronize an optimus file
x beat-sync chroma to mats;
x adjust to taemin's code:
    time_points -> beats_in_time and endT
    labseg
    if band is 1, does chroma need to be 3D?
    write out / load intermediary posteriors to provide an entry point
x re-run taemin's system
- tab training script is going to die (transform_data no longer exists)
    fix once it fails
    adapt script such that convolutional application can be run without training
- re-run the chord classifiers; chroma, tonnetz, and autotab should be fine
- compute class / quality distribution weights
- wtf to do with Tonnetz..? run the GMM in python and pass posteriors?
- score beat-sync versus fixed-frame features (can / should I do this?)
- move
    Taemin's code to bowery, should run successfully there
    tmc_features/band-{1,4}
    learned_features/...
